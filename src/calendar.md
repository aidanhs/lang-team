# Calendar

We have a lang-team calendar that shows the time for our various meetings.
Meetings are generally open to anyone who wants to listen in. We also try to
post [minutes](https://github.com/rust-lang/lang-team/tree/master/minutes) (and recordings, if any) on a "best-effort" basis from our
meetings.

- [View calendar][caldav] -- use this to view the calendar online and add it to your Google Calendar
- [ICS file, for use outside from google calendar][ics] -- you can use this to subscribe from other programs

You can find a list of upcoming design meetings here:

## Subteam Calendars

Some subteams of the lang team reuse the primary lang team calendar for their own calendar events, while others may choose to create a separate calendar. The calendars of all subteams that do not use the main calendar should be listed below:
